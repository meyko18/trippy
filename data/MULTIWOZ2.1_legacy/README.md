Note that this is a split (into train, val, test) of the mid 2019 version of MultiWOZ 2.1, which can be found at https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.41572

The dataset has since been updated and the most recent version of MultiWOZ 2.1 will therefore differ
from the version we used for the experiments that we report in
[TripPy: A Triple Copy Strategy for Value Independent Neural Dialog State Tracking](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.sigdial-1.4/)

For the most recent version of MultiWOZ, please see https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz.git
